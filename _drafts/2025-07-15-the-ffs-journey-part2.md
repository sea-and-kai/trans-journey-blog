### Recovery - The Marbella days
The whole recovery had very little pain overall. All they gave me was ibuprofen and acetominophen the whole time. There was just a lot of uncomfortable sleeping sitting upright for the first week and a very large appetite, despite low activity. 

The first day or two of recovery are foggy, not so much from the painkillers but the sleeping pills which I found made me violently groggy all day even after awaking. In the hospital I watched Will Ferrel's documentary with his trans friend Harper. It felt like an appropriate thing to watch. Then I tried Pilomena Cunk and started to laugh so hard that my lip-lift stitches felt tight so I abadoned that.

Laughing with a big smile was dangerzone for a while, in fact. Many week after surgery I was cautious of smiling too big and worried maybe the procedure would tighten my ability to smile for good. There was a lot of this kind of worry to come in the weeks following surgery. 8 days post-op the bandages and stitches were all removed and it was a new time of reckoning for seeing my own results. Until everything was removed I didnt have much of a way to process what thigns looked like. Afterwards the levels of swelling and discoloration really set in.

Depending what procedures you get done

- stitches off 8 days
- photos and post-op consultation
    - the anxiety of looking bad still
