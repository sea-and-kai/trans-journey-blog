> I decided to wait a little bit of time before I wrote the part 2 of this blog. Even at 6 months recovery, as I am now, there's still plenty more ahead of me. However, I think the majority of what is most eventful has already happened now. Physical and mental recovery continue, but at a minor level compared to how they were influencing me at the start.

### Initial Recovery - The rest of my euro trip

When I ended my previous blog entry I was just waking up from the anesthesia and getting rolled back to me room for recovery. Because part of my procedure included rhinoplasty, I was not supposed to breathe through it for the first night, which I didn't find particularly difficult. Perhaps being a competitive swimmer as a kid had prepared me to control my breathing on this without even thinking much.

Including the first night, the recovery process actually had very little pain overall. It was mostly just discomfort. In fact, all they gave me for pain was ibuprofen and acetominophen the whole time. The trickiest part was just the uncomfortable sleeping due to needing to sit upright for the first week. I also noticed that initially I had a very large appetite, despite low activity. My body was clearly in a high alert recovery phase and consuming all the energy it could to get me mended. 

The first couple days of recovery are foggy, not so much from the painkillers, but rather the sleeping pills they gave us. I found they made me violently groggy all day, even after awaking. In the hospital I watched Will Ferrel's documentary with his trans friend Harper. It felt like an appropriate thing to watch. Then I tried Pilomena Cunk and started to laugh so hard that my lip-lift stitches felt tight so I abadoned that. I had to actually be somewhat careful about humor in my first week of recovery. Little jokes were fine, but big laughs were borderline danegrous if they made me want to smile too widely. Many week after surgery I was cautious of smiling too widely. I started to worry that maybe the procedure would tighten my ability to smile for good. There was a lot of this kind of worry to come in the weeks of recovery following surgery.

 8 days after surgery the bandages and stitches were all removed. It was a new time of reckoning for seeing my own results. Until that point I didnt have much of a way to process what things looked like. Afterwards the levels of swelling and discoloration in my face really became clear to me.

Depending what procedures you get done, you age and your genetics, recovery looks very different from patient to patient. However, that doesn't necessarily feel apparent when you compare your recovery to that of others. Nor does the fact that we are much more sensitive about the details of our own face. It was very hard for me to see past the swelling and discoloration in my face. Others told me I was looking good already, but I couldn't really see it for myself.

After 11 days I had my post-op consultation and photos taken at the clinic. I was very anxious leading up to this because I still felt very unsettled about how I looked. They put a bit of makeup on me after taking photos without any on, but I felt like makeup made things look worse. The swelling made more sense when it was accompanied by visible bruising.

I still was going through a lot of mental processing, but I was feeling better and better every day. I knew the healing process had only begun, but I found myself very emotional through recover for the first while. We travelled to Lisbon for a short stay before returning home. I had a good time there but found myself exhausted easily by even short walks. My body was still recovering a lot even though it was becoming less apparent from my appearance.

## Returning home
When I returned home it was nice to finally settle into my own space after 3 weeks away. The swelling and bruising in my face continued to be a bother, but I saw improvements day over day. I found my face looked swollen more in the mornings after I had been lying down for hours. Nonetheless I was getting a lot of positive reception from friends about how the results were starting to look.

It was hard for me to leave the house for a while. I didnt really like facing the public while I felt uncomfortable about my own appearance but I learned bit by bit that most people couldn't even tell. They don't know my face as well as I do, afterall! I worked from home for the first 8 weeks and didn't go go into the office on Fridays as I usually do, or even use my camera for a while. My workplace was understanding and supportive of this journey for me so it wasn't a bother or surprise to anyone.

## Reaching cruising altitude
I had my first outing at 5 weeks of recovery. I went to a Blue Jays game with some friends. It was a fun time and my friends were very kind and affirming of how things were looking. It was good that a pushed myself a little bit, I think, even though when I look back at the photos I notice there really was a lot of swelling compared to how I look now.

At 6 weeks I was able to start exercising again, which I started very lightly. At 8 weeks I was starting to get a lot more confidence to go out and start forgetting about my recovery.

## The 3 month recovery marker

    - swelling under much better control
    - more attention from women, about the same from men
    - confidence rising
    - still maybe pushing for normalcy too soon
    - pushing for dating asap

## 6 months recovery
