It is sometimes hard to share my experience with people, either because the subject matter is too heavy to bring up in casual conversation, or the questions are never really asked.

### This blog was originally an interactive storytelling experience
The first 10 blog entries were written in quick succession over the course of 1 weekend during a game jam. If you'd like to read them through the original experience visit [a-trans-journey.netlify.app](https://a-trans-journey.netlify.app)
