Thanks for taking the time to read as much or as little of this as interested you.

Depending on how much you read, or the order you read it in, you may draw different conclusions about who I am or how I'm doing these days. The short answer is **I'm doing really awesome**. Life continues to improve every day. I'm grateful again for my supportive friends and family through this.

The other day someone was telling me about how I was brave. While I don't disagree that it takes steps of courage along the way to drive forward, I'm not sure I see myself as particularly brave. It has felt like something I just needed to do, because the alternatives were worse. It feels more like getting out of quicksand. Why would I be brave for escaping quicksand? That's just survival.

Despite navigating new challenges, quality of life has gone up. The brighter I shine, the easier navigating or completely avoiding the junkier side of trans journeys has become because I'm built on top of it.

Some of my friends reading this already follow me on Instagram, but many of you don't. If you want to reach out and stay more in touch with me let's connect there -- [@sea_and_kai](https://www.instagram.com/sea_and_kai)
